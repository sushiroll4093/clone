## Trying Out Canvas

If you'd like to use Canvas in your own course, or you just want try out Canvas, there is no need to do all the work of installing it yourself. [Canvas Cloud](https://canvas.instructure.com/register) is free for teachers to use. [Sign up](https://canvas.instructure.com/register) to get started.

If at a later time you do want to migrate from your own installation to Canvas Cloud, or vice versa, you can use the course export and import features to migrate all of your content.
